# Tree_Traversal

Given a tree with each node stores an integer value.

Please implement a method sumOfQualifiedValues(TreeNode root, int min, int max). 

This method should return the summation of all values that are greater than or equal to min and less than or equal to max (i.e., min <= value <= max).

Input: the root node of the tree; the min and max values.

Output: the summation of all qualified values in the tree.
